    <h2>My First Week at Galvanize</h2>

    <p>
    My first week at Galvanize has been a great experience. Although I am
    still quite naive when it comes to coding, I am picking up on some
    important techniques and skillsets that I will need to be succesful.
    I find that the daily structure of Galvanize is proving to be effective.
    <p> Some goals for the next couple of weeks...
    </p>

    <ul>Become effective using the terminal</ul>
    <ul>Master the process of GitHub</ul>
    <ul>Introduce myself to topics in jQuery and Javascript</ul>
    <ul>Dive into advanced HTML and CSS techniques</ul>
