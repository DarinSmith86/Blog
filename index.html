    <h2>My First Week at Galvanize</h2>
  </div>
    <p>
    My first week at Galvanize has been a great experience.<br> Although I am
    still quite naive when it comes to coding, <br>I am picking up on some
    important techniques and skillsets<br> that I will need to be succesful.
    I find that the daily structure<br> of Galvanize is proving to be effective.
    <p> Some goals for the next couple of weeks...
    </p>

    <li>Become effective using the terminal</li>
    <li>Master the process of GitHub</li>
    <li>Introduce myself to topics in jQuery and Javascript</li>
    <li>Dive into advanced HTML and CSS techniques</li>
